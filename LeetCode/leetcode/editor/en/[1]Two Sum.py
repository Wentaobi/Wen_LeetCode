# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they a
# dd up to a specific target. 
# 
#  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may n
# ot use the same element twice. 
# 
#  Example: 
# 
#  
# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
# 
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].
